# Risk Profiling

Given a true temperature, calculate the probability of getting an error given the true value is T where the probability of T is also given.
Also, program the same.

Calculate the probability of cost given the true error i.e. P(C/E).

(You can make required assumptions, mention the same in your respective reports.)
