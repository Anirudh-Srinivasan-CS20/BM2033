# Learn Hand-Written Digits using Probability

Create a 4x4 pixel image and write either 0 or 1 in it.
Get 100 different varieties of 0 and 1.
Pool all the 0s and 1s and let this be known as X. (where X = {X[1] , X[2] , . . . , X[16]})

Let Y = {Y[1] , Y[2] , . . . , Y[16]} be a new input.
Find the probability of 1 given Y and probability of 0 given Y.
